# ProjectHW3-JS

My homework in a different format because I chose to follow the tutorial that I liked, that were more helpful and easy to understand. And the product I can use in real life, not just as a practice. 

I watched multiple youtub tutorial to build this page. I do not feel confident about Javascript yet, I would say I feel incredibly unintelligent, because how little I can understand. For most of the activities we have in class I have to watch the tutorials, and it helps not to feel that discouraged. 

 We are moving too fast in class for me to follow.  I only can follow tutorials to build something useful.
